# BadPongClone
It's a bad version of pong, it's slower, less performent, and ~~doesn't use fancy math(you're stuck in a pong loop pretty much).~~ oh wait it does use fancy math.

Still got a bunch of issues like:
- ball getting out of the playing field sometimes
- ball stuttering and going through paddles
- no pause button or screen
- probably got more that i didn't notice...
