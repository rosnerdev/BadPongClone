# BadPongClone
It's a bad version of pong, it's slower and less performent.

Still got a bunch of issues like:
- No pause button or screen
- It's very buggy!
- Probably got more that i didn't notice...

Controls:
- W and S(Up and Down) for the left paddle.
- Up and Down arrows for the right paddle.
